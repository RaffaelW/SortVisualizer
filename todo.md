## Doing


## Done

+ change orientation to portrait when leaving the visualizer screen in
  portrait mode
+ change color theming
+ launcher icon
+ show algorithm best/worst/average time complexity, ...
+ save latest delay and list size value
+ button to restore default values for delay, listSize
+ full screen
+ choose better fitting delay values
+ resolved bugs:
  + java.lang.IllegalStateException: Surface has already been released
    (ChartSurfaceView, l. 138)
  + SurfaceView is empty when activity is paused &rarr; exit app, screen
    turned off, screen rotated
